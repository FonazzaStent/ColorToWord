Generate list (part of Color to Word)
The program will read a word list from a text file and convert each
word to RGB color values, through the algorithm used in the
program Text to Color, found on GitHub and SourceForge profile pages
of Fonazza-Stent. A file called wordcolor.txt will be generated,
containing the list of words processed by the program, with each
word followed by the corresponding RGB color values, in CSV format.
The list can be used with the Color to Word program to find all the
word matches in the list for a given color.
In order for the program to work, the word list must be strictly in
text format and the file must be called words.txt
Instructions:
- Put the executable and the word.txt file containing the word
list in the same folder
- Run the generate_list.exe program
- Wait for the program to complete the conversion
- Find the wordcolor.txt file in the same folder
- Copy the file to the Color to Word program folder
