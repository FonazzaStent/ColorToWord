Color to Word 1.0.0

The program will turn a color into a list of 10 words, obtained
according to a custom designed algorithm based on letter shape
and position in the alphabet.

- Click inside the frame on the left to pick a color through the
  color chooser window
- The program will match the color with the colors corresponding
  to a list of all the English words contained in the file
  wordcolor.txt
- The first 10 matches will appear in the frame on the right
- Right-click - Copy to copy the word matches and the RGB values

This version comes with a text file (wordcolor.txt) containing
all the English words followed by Red, Green, Blue channel values
for the corresponding color. The colors were obtained through a
modified version of the program "Text to Color" by same author,
available for download on GitHub and SourceForge on the profile
page of Fonazza-Stent.
The next version (coming soon) will include a tool to convert a
custom word list into a word+color list named wordcolor.txt to be
used with the program.
Do not delete the file wordcolor.txt or the program will crash.
